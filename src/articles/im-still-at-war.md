This is an incredible movie. As Newton’s Third Law of Motion states: “For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.” Whether you win or you lose, whether you torture or you are tortured, you will have a scar as deep as the one you inflict or the one you are inflicted.

This is a story beyond war. It is a story about understanding, acceptance, forgiveness, peace and love.

“War leaves a mark.”
