There’s a lot of snow this morning and it reminds me of a conversation I was listening to during the holidays, between people with more life experience than me.

I’m going straight to the takeaway from that conversation: If you really want to encourage people to use public transportation and leave their cars at home, you should get snow off sidewalks first. This is especially true in areas within 10-20 minutes of walking distance from a metro station.

I remembered this conversation because I was driving to work this morning and noticed that roads were clear, but not sidewalks.
