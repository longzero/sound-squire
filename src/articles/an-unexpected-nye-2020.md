An unexpected NYE.

Year after year, I always expect to be alone, then last year (last night), some friends showed up for the countdown, all spread out in front of my house.

That moment turned a regular night into a very good NYE, considering a pandemic, a broken leg and cold weather. Nice way to transition years.

Happy new year!
