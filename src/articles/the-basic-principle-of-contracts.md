I hate contracts. I am not indifferent, I do not not like them, I completely hate them. Contract is one word to say “there is lack of trust and reliability”.

Take cell phone companies that get customers to sign contracts. I would believe that if their service is good, customers would stay with them even without a contract. By making people sign a contract, they are basically saying “We offer you our service, but we aren’t sure that it won’t suck, so we want you to sign to make sure you stay with us (we really mean stick with us) even when we go down”.

Contract = “I don’t trust you, sign here”.

Personally, I would kill people for food, you can trust me on that.
