If you’re going to set yourself reachable goals, you should question what drives you; what gets you out of bed?

The worst part of reachable goals is the moment you reach them, because… What’s next? Do you just stop getting out of bed and die?

In my life, I’ve heard so many people, including friends and family, who set goals they can easily attain.

That’s just like getting a quick fix to raise dopamine levels for a short time. It’s simply unsustainable for the rest of your life.

Unreachable goals will give you motivation for the rest of your life. As such, it is never reaching those goals. It’s never about the destination, but it’s always about the journey.

“A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.” ~Bruce Lee
