I value the quality of my sleep more than the quantity of my sleep.

I don’t know what happens during sleep because I don’t put electrodes on my head, but I know that I don’t remain awake for hours when I go to bed and I know that I don’t snooze the alarm clock when I wake up. I can’t anyway, I don’t have one.

That’s how I care more about quality than quantity with regard to sleep; by feeling good when I go to bed and by feeling good when I wake up. In terms of quantity, for all I care, I just slept 4 hours, 8 hours, 11 hours; none of it matters if I feel like crap.
