I had my first MacBook in 2006 when Apple transitioned to Intel processors. Since then, the Mac is the computer I would advise people to get.

Today is a different story. Times have changed. Steve Jobs isn’t putting his foot down anywhere. Apple has become more about making money than about making good products.

This is my new position: Unless you’re coding or need specialized software, don’t get a desktop or a laptop computer, because if all you do is answer email and write documents and spreadsheets, you only need a smartphone.

If you’re very inclined to have a computer, get the cheapest one. That’s good enough. If you want more than “good enough”, get a computer from either Apple or Microsoft.

I’m not even about Mac or Windows anymore, except when it comes to coding.
