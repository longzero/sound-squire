Being in Vietnam makes me realize something I miss dearly: Chaos in the streets.

What I mean by that is people jaywalking all over the place and drivers of all sorts of vehicles swifting through the streets.

In chaos, honking means “be careful”. It’s an alert to your presence. In North America, honking is aggressive and insulting and means “Get the fuck out of my way.”

People here are more focused on avoiding obstacles on their way rather than expecting obstacles to behave a certain way.
