I drink less alcohol when things aren’t going so well. That’s very much the opposite behaviour of a lot of people.

The way I see it is things aren’t going well, so why would you make them worse. I don’t believe for a second that anybody wants to stay in a bad situation.

In short, when things go well, I have peace of mind and I can afford to put energy on letting loose, but when things go bad, I spend 100% of my energy to get out of the bad situation.
