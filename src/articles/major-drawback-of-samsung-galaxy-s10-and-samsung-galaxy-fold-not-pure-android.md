If the Samsung Galaxy S10 was made by Apple, I would think about getting it. If it was made by Google, I would think about breaking my 500$ max phone rule and probably get it.

Yeahâ€¦ My biggest problem with it is it isnâ€™t a top operating system which is neither Android nor iOS.

Why this obsession? Because when thereâ€™s a feature or security update, iOS and >pure< Android are the first to get it.
