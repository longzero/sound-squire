It isn’t everyday that I get the chance to work on the website of a festival. In fact, for this one, it was never part of the plan for me to do it, one had already been done. I was asked what I thought of it and I remember that one of things I said was “It looks like something coming from the last century”. I would find it quite harsh if someone said that about one of my designs, but it was true. I found out that the person behind the previous design was in the business for much longer than I am, but I have the feeling that he doesn’t stay up to date with current trends. Unfortunately, since then, that previous design is gone. Even the domain name was poorly chosen; it just wasn’t memorable.

My involvement resulted in a beautiful website easy to navigate and focused. This is the first time I use the word “focused” to describe a website, but it’s important to mention, because the old design was all over the place.
