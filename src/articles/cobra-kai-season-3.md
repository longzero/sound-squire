Happy new year everyone!

2021 starts with the release of season 3 of Cobra Kai on Netflix. I binged-watched it and it turned out to be a great way to start the year.

This season made much more sense to me than season 2 in which I thought fights started for no good reason at all. Fights make more sense in season 3 and the storyline does as well.

The season starts where the previous season left off; it is the aftermath of the school fight and the rest develops from there. It gets better and better from episode to episode and I absolutely love the return of an old character from the Karate Kid movies.

I really love how season 3 ended with the Christmas music during one of the fight scene as well as Phil Collinsâ€™s In the Air Tonight.

I definitely recommend Cobra Kai 3.
