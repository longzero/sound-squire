This is something almost nobody knows about me. This is a personal story for people who feel like they are in a craphole and they want to get out of it, but don’t know how. This is the way I did it.

2013 was the worst year of my life. Towards the end, I had trouble looking for a job I wanted to make websites, but I also needed to do something to make money. I became a delivery boy for a private delivery company and decided to look for a job I really wanted in the evening after work.

The pay was one of the worst pay in my life. I didn’t like the job. I worked long hours and it drained a ton of energy out of me. I was a monster on the road. It drained so much energy that I wasn’t even looking for a job after work.

Two months later, I got in my car for another workday and looked at myself in the mirror and said: “You’re a fucking idiot! You’re never going to make websites again and learn anything new if you stay on this path!”

Right then and there, I was totally disgusted with what the mirror was showing me, so I called my boss and quit.

I knew there was only one way for me to get back on the right path: I had to ignore conventional wisdom: “Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket.” So I proceeded to put all of my eggs in one basket. It was either: get a job making websites or die. It was that simple. During those two months of deliveries, I was destroying my soul without realizing it.

I was single, with no kids and my entourage was healthy. The most important things in my life were covered, so ultimately, there was no reason for me to deviate from the path I needed to be on.

After that, it took two to three months to finally get a job that made sense, a job I could use as a foundation for things to come.

The lesson of my story is the opposite of what so many people say: Put all of your eggs in one basket. No one foot on one side and the other foot on the other side. No distraction. No hesitation. No playing safe, because ironically, it’s insanely dangerous to scatter your eggs all over the place. You can’t claim to have done your best if you didn’t put in everything you’ve got, if you didn’t put in maximum effort.

Whatever you do, whether you’re playing music, building your career, building your company, maintaining your relationships, parenting your kids, trying to keep your partner happy, etc, just go all in. Don’t hold back.

Just go all in.
