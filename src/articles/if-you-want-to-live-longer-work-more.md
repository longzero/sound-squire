It seems there are many people, young and old, who think of retirement as a requirement for you to feel like you’re free and (finally) living.

If that is the case for you, you will never live. For some reason, your mindset causes you to see work as a negative.

A study conducted in blue zones (places where people live longer) showed common traits among those who live longer: optimism, resilience, good relationships, etc. These traits aren’t surprising, but the one that stood out the most: willingness to work.

“There is no need to ever retire, but if one must, it should be a lot later than 65”, said someone who was 97 and died at 105.

Some may say it’s better to live a happy short life than a miserable long life. I used to think that. Here’s the thing though: if you are alive, you always have a chance to spin things whichever way you desire.

My grandfather is in his 80s or 90s and still goes to work every day walking around like Master Yoda.
